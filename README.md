# WordleUnlimited_Bruteforce
Bruteforce script for WordleUnlimited

Requires a txt file with all english words (can be found here: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)

Demonstration:

How to use:
- Input the path to your words file
- Input the word length
- You will get an ideal starting word
- Some english words are not valid on WordleUnlimited.com or similar sites so you will be asked if your word works
- if your word works enter y if not enter n to get a new one
- once you have a working word entered into wordle you will be sent to the checks screen
- the program will query each character from you unless it already knows its correct
- enter x for a character that grayed out, u for a character that shows up orange and c for a character that shows up green
- if your word does not work enter b on the first letter
- now the program will give you the next word to enter and ask you about it again
- repeat this process until you solve the puzzle

Please not that this can not solve all puzzles as the word needs to be in the list and it can not solve all of them fast enough if there is a lot of possibilities.
If you find any bugs please report them thanks!
